# shopping-list-react-native
A shopping list application I made while following along with the [Traversy Media tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4MJH0jDb4), which I hope to build up on.

## Motivation
I've done a lot of web development but never really dipped my toes into mobile development. Since I was familiar with React, I wanted to learn how to use React Native to make mobile apps. Following this tutorial was also in preparation for a [Blackjack app](https://github.com/cBridges851/blackjack) I'm making. 

## Tech Framework Used
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/400/1*mrOXGyIa3BlPK80peLmEbA.png" width="20"/> React Native - [see docs](https://reactnative.dev/)

## Installation
- Do the good old git clone https://github.com/cBridges851/shopping-list-react-native.git
- npm install to install the NPM packages

## Usage
### Android
- Make sure you have Android Studio installed
- Go to the AVD Manager and press the play button next to the simulator you wish to run the app on
- Navigate inside the project's folder in the terminal
- Run Metro - `npx react-native start`
- Start Android - `npx react-native run-android`

## Contributions
This is purely a learning repository for myself, but if you have any ideas or learning curves that I could do, please submit an issue!

## Future Plans
- I need to get more confident and comfortable with front-end unit tests, so I'll be using this repo as an opportunity to write some unit tests :)
