# shopping-list-react-native
A shopping list application I made while following along with the [Traversy Media tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hf4MJH0jDb4), which I hope to build up on.

## Motivation 💪
I've done a lot of web development but never really dipped my toes into mobile development. Since I was familiar with React, I wanted to learn how to use React Native to make mobile apps. Following this tutorial was also in preparation for a [Blackjack app](https://github.com/cBridges851/blackjack) I'm making. 

## Tech Framework Used 👩‍💻
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/400/1*mrOXGyIa3BlPK80peLmEbA.png" width="20"/> React Native - [see docs](https://reactnative.dev/)

## Installation ⬇

- npm install to install the NPM packages

## Contributions ✉
This is purely a learning repository for myself, but if you have any ideas or learning curves that I could do, please submit an issue!

## Future Plans 💭
- I need to get more confident and comfortable with front-end unit tests, so I'll be using this repo as an opportunity to write some unit tests :)
